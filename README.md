# Semantic Segmentation with PyTorch

![Semantic Segmentation Example](images/segmentation_example.png)

This repository contains a semantic segmentation model implemented in Python using PyTorch. Semantic segmentation is a computer vision task where the goal is to classify each pixel in an image into a specific class. This can be used for various applications, such as object detection, image segmentation, and more.

## Features

- EfficientNet-based architecture for semantic segmentation.
- Data preprocessing and augmentation.
- Training and evaluation scripts.
- Inference scripts for segmentation on new images.
- Pretrained model weights for quick usage.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/semantic-segmentation-pytorch.git

    Navigate to the project directory:

    bash

cd semantic-segmentation-pytorch

Install the required dependencies:

bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Training

    Modify the configuration file (config.yaml) to specify the dataset path, model hyperparameters, and training settings.

    Start training by running the following command:

    bash

    python train.py --config config.yaml

    The model will be trained and saved to the model_weights/ directory.

Inference

    Use the pretrained model to perform inference on new images by running:

    bash

    python inference.py --model_path model_weights/best_model.pth --image_path path/to/your/image.jpg

    The segmentation result will be saved as an image in the output/ directory.
