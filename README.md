# Semantic Segmentation with PyTorch

![Semantic Segmentation Example](images/segmentation_example.png)

This repository contains a semantic segmentation model implemented in Python using PyTorch. Semantic segmentation is a computer vision task where the goal is to classify each pixel in an image into a specific class. This can be used for various applications, such as object detection, image segmentation, and more.

## Features

- EfficientNet-based architecture for semantic segmentation.
- Data preprocessing and augmentation.
- Training and evaluation scripts.
- Inference scripts for segmentation on new images.
- Pretrained model weights for quick usage.
